# H-hat Logo

## Symbol

The H-hat logo features **Ĥ** (Latin capital letter H with circumflex).

## Meaning

The circumflex (ˆ) is significant in quantum mechanics:

- **Hamiltonian operator**: Denoted as Ĥ in quantum mechanics
- **Operator notation**: The "hat" notation (ˆ) is standard for operators in quantum theory
- **Mathematical heritage**: Connects the language to its quantum physics roots

## Technical Details

- **Unicode**: U+0124 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H WITH CIRCUMFLEX)
- **HTML Entity**: `&Hcirc;` or `&#292;`
- **LaTeX**: `\hat{H}` or `\^{H}`
