# Code of Conduct

## Core Principle

**We coexist in the same world. So be nice to others as you expect others to be nice to you.**

This simple principle guides all interactions in the H-hat community.

## Community Standards

The H-hat community is built on mutual respect and collaboration. We expect everyone to:

- Treat others with kindness and respect
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Focus technical discussions on the work, not the person
- Assume good intentions and resolve disagreements constructively
- Give credit where credit is due

## If Problems Arise

So far, the H-hat community has been welcoming and respectful. If unacceptable behavior occurs:

- Address minor issues directly if you feel comfortable
- For serious concerns, contact project maintainers via Discord or GitHub
- Maintainers will handle issues fairly and with discretion

Project maintainers may take appropriate action as needed, from warnings to removal from community spaces.
